# SSD Storage Override - NOT WORKING
# Docker Desktop for Mac cannot mount external drives (/Volumes/*)
# This file is kept for reference but the SSD feature requires a workaround.
#
# Alternative: Run transfers on the host machine outside of Docker,
# or use S3 storage instead.

# services:
#   web:
#     volumes:

#   worker:
#     volumes:
#       - /Volumes/Imago/MHC-Control_Panel/media:/mnt/ssd/mhc-images
